**CVSS Score:** 9.8  

## Summary

On 18 Dec 2019, SonicWall CSIRT released Security Advisories SNWLID-2019-0016 to SNWLID-2019-0021 [[link](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-list)], which identified a vulnerabilities in SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances. The most dangerous one among them, [CVE-2019-7482](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7482), could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

The vulnerability received a score of **9.8** and was deemed **Critical**.

Affected software builds are **9.0.0.3** and earlier. Vulnerabilities have been fixed in the release **9.0.0.4**, which is available for download from [My SonicWall Download Center](https://www.mysonicwall.com/muir/ui/downloadcenter).

The original advisory stated only SMA100 appliance are vulnerable, but my tests showed that at least SMA500v and old Secure Remote Access (SRA) appliances share the same code base and therefore also vulnerable. SMA200 and SMA400 running vulnerable software version also could be at risk. SMA 6200, 7200, 8200v and 9000 seem to be built on other platform and not affected.

> If you are security representative of AS owner or country CERT who wants to track the spread of the vulnerability in the networks you are responsible please contact me via [email][mailto:b4bay@b4bay.com] or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/b4baysky). All data sets are freely available for authorized persons.

## Exploit Detection

At the moment there is no public exploit available. Based on information disclosed by Alain Mowat, these entry points should be monitored:

- **GET** to **/cgi-bin/supportLogin**, for SQL Injection patterns in *customerTID* parameter,
- **GET** to **/cgi-bin/supportLogin**, for unusually long *User-Agent* header values,
- **GET** to **/cgi-bin/handleWAFRedirect**, for Path Traversal patterns in *hdl* parameter.

Unfortunately, network traffic to the vulnerabilities entry points is encrypted by TLS, so there is no convenient way to detect exploitng attempts. You have to manage to obtain the unencrypted copy of traffic before applying detection rules. 

## In-the-Wild Exploiting

At this point there are no evidence of any public exploitaion attempts.
